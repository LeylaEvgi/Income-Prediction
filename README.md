# Income-Prediction
Predict whether income exceeds $50K/yr based on census data. 

Data Set Information
Extraction was done by Barry Becker from the 1994 Census database. A set of reasonably clean records was extracted using the following conditions: ((AAGE>16) && (AGI>100) && (AFNLWGT>1)&& (HRSWK>0)).

Prediction task is to determine whether a person makes over 50K a year.

In this project, after the dataset was cleaned and made suitable for the model, it was integrated into 5 different models.
Also added streamlit codes.
